# justloginpoc

POC on Xamarin.

A basic App with a login and display of data using WebAPI.

POC was done to understand basic code sharing in Xamarin for both Android and iOS platforms, most of the features have been mocked up and not fully implemented.

Features explored are:
1. Xamarin Forms.
2. PCL - Portable Class Libraries.
3. Resful API. ( WebAPI project was hosted on local system in IIS and the Wifi network was used to test).

The Application flow is as follows:

<p>1. A Login page ( default credentials are username = "a" and password = "a" ).</p>
<p>2. A Create user page ( dummy page ).</p>
<p>3. A Home page to display all features of the App.</p>
<p>4. A Personal details page ( Details of the person who is logged into the app ).</p>
<p>5. A Search page to list all persons and search.</p>
